# laser_merge
ROS node to merge LaserScan data from lidar and kinect sensors in Kinetic

Written by two UNC Asheville Mechatronics students. None of the current available nodes work in kinetic so we wrote one that would.

To use:
1. `cd ~/catkin_ws/src`
2. `git clone https://github.com/marshallpowell97/laser_merge.git`
3. edit launch file in laser_merge to match your system
4. `cd catkin_ws && catkin_make`
